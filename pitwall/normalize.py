"""Turn raw iRacing variables into the protocol messages in docs/PROTOCOL.md.

Provenance rule (the whole point of this project):
    * Anything under a plain key is copied straight from an iRacing variable.
    * Anything under a "derived" key was computed here. The UI must label it.
    * Tire wear / tread values are copied as-is but flagged "snapshot" in the
      protocol docs because the sim only refreshes them at pit stops.

No module above this one is allowed to compute racing math from raw variables;
if a number needs deriving, it happens here under "derived" so it is auditable
in one place.

    # instead of a time. Observed at Daytona: the leader crossing the line
    # flipped P2/P3 to real gaps (2.3722 / 2.4418) while P10, still on lap 1,
    # stayed on 0.0090. So the placeholder clears per car, not per session, and
    # a car's F2Time is only trustworthy once that car has a completed lap.
    # A completed lap is necessary but NOT sufficient. Observed mid-race at VIR:
    # P4 carried a real 2.8702 while P5 and P6 still carried placeholders of
    # 0.0020 and 0.0050 despite both having genuine last-lap times (104.496,
    # 104.750). Differencing those produced -2.868. Across one 15-minute race
    # that pattern yielded 1459 negative intervals.
    #
    # The property that actually holds is monotonicity: time behind the leader
    # cannot DECREASE as you go down the running order. So we track the last
    # F2Time we trusted and reject any car whose value falls below it -- that
    # car's F2Time disagrees with its scored position, and when the sim's two
    # signals disagree we show nothing rather than invent a gap.

    # "+0.001, +0.002, +0.003" down the field on lap 1 as though they were times.
